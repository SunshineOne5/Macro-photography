800 distorted images are based on 100 reference images through four different types of distortion, which are JPEG, JPEG 2000, White Noise, Gblur.


In order to better collect the scores of the subjects on the images, I specially compiled a small software to collect scores, called subjective quality assessment. If you are interested in this small software, please send me an email. My email is 1091492953@qq.com
